Welcome to the historical debut - the **first edition** (#1) of [Week In The Privacy News](https://news.web3privacy.info/).

## Privacy awareness starts in 1,2,3

_Have you ever tried to follow privacy news?_ Spending hours & hours every week & still lacking a clear picture of the latest updates.

The Web3Privacy Now community solves this issue

Every week - **1 curated round-up of the most important news related to privacy in the Web3**. Freedom, security and decentralisation topics as a bonus.
